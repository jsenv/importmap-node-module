# This is a GitHub workflow YAML file
# see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
#
# If you want to update this file it's recommended to use a YAML validator

# configured to validate with https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow.json
#
# This workflow is responsible to perform various checks related to the codebase,
# For every push to main or on a pull request, it
# - ensures there is no eslint error on files
# - ensures there is no test failing
# - uploads code coverage from tests to codecov
#
# If all these steps are passing and there is a secrets.NPM_TOKEN and version in package.json
# is not already published, workflow published the package on npm.
