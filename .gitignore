# importmap generated by "npm run generate-importmap" is dependent
# of "node_modules" directory content.
# "node_modules" directory content might change often and be non deterministic,
# especially after npm install without using "package-lock.json".
# As this file is generated dynamically and might have non deterministic content
# due to its dependency to "node_modules" it's simpler not to track it.

# jsconfig.json is generated by "npm run generate-importmap". jsconfig.json
# tells VSCode where are the files until it natively support import maps.
# -> no need to track a file generated dynamically
/jsconfig.json

# package-lock.json is generated by "npm install".
# It's a good practice to have it tracked by git.
# In practice tracking this file is a pain: git conflicts and random errors.
# Maybe today npm is finally stable and does not randomly fail when package-lock.json
# is tracked by git. Until it's tested again and confirmed I prefer
# to ignore package-lock.json.
# -> do not track package-lock.json

# secrets.json is a file where you can put secret data
# that must not be published by git.
# Please don't yell at me for doing this.
