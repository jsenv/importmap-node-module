# [0_import_fs_browser](../../js_import_fs.test.mjs#L20)

```js
run({
  runtime: "browser",
})
```

# 1/3 console.warn

```console

Import resolution failed for "fs"
--- import trace ---
base/input/index.js:1:7
> 1 | import "fs";
    |       ^
  2 | 
--- reason ---
there is no mapping for this bare specifier
--- suggestion 1 ---
use runtime: "node"

```

# 2/3 write file "./input/test.importmap"

```importmap
{
  "imports": {},
  "scopes": {}
}
```

# 3/3 resolve

```js
undefined
```
